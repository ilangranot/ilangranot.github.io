My personal website

1. Contents
This project contains my Resume as a website HTML based project.
I have used a template of Bootstrap (found at: https://startbootstrap.com/themes/). This template contains the general structure which underwent extensive modifications, and where 
All known unneeded elements were removed and many other elements have been added.
Wherever elements that are based on the API of any of the libraries such as Bootstrap, JQuery, Google Maps, etc. were used there may have been use of some code from the API's online documentation website. Other than that all code is original and belongs to me.

2. Running
To run please extract the zip to a local folder on your computer and open index.html with your browser. This project has been tested with recent versions of both Chrome and Safari on a Mac. In index.html please replace the API key with one you get from Google Cloud at https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key
