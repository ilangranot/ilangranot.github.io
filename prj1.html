                        <p>US20200104146A1 is a patent application that, together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EASIC" target="_blank">Zvi Or-Bach</a>, I have submitted with the US Patent & Trademark Office.
                        This patent has recently received a Notice of Allowance (NOA) from the USPTO which means it is granted as a patent.
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200104146A1" target="_blank">link</a> to the application and the abstract of the invention:<br/>
                            More and more people are interacting with computer based applications. In many cases these interaction are not routine, but rather very occasional. Hence, the users may not know or remember all of the common commands, etc. for the use of a specific computer based application.
                            While these applications are designed to be friendly for their users, some users face difficulties and their interactions with some of these applications which are time consuming and frustrating.
                            The invention is a software that helps novice users by showing them suggestions about how the more experienced users have used a specific software.
                            This patent is the base to a <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/HWe7NfZ4XwUwz/" target="_blank">startup</a> I plan on launching.
